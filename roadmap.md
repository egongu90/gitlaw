# MVP:
- SAST, unit tests, packaging (signed, attested, provenance)

# Must have:
- Support for github
- Funtional tests
- CI template/Github Action

# Nice to have
- Config file pre execution validation and linter
- Log state, changed, misconfigured or rendered config values in file for attestations --output result.json
- Support for bitbucket and other scm
- Multi thread, paralelism
